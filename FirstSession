# Log Script
  Today, I learned the basics and intermediate concepts of Shell Scripting (Bash). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what I covered:
      Variables and Arithmetic Operations:
        How to declare and use variables
        Different ways to perform arithmetic in Bash
      Loops (for, while, until):
        Repeating commands using loops
        Using conditions inside loops
      Conditional Statements:
        Using if, elif, else, and case to make decisions
      Functions:
        How to define and call functions
        How to pass arguments to functions
      File Handling and Search:
        Finding files with find
        Checking size and permissions
        Filtering files by size or type


# Example 
```# Variable assignment
      num1=10
      num2=5

  # Using let
    let "sum = num1 + num2"
    echo $sum  # Output: 15

  # Using expr
    echo $(expr $num1 + $num2)  # Output: 15

  # Using arithmetic expansion
    echo $((num1 - num2))  # Output: 5

```
    age=20
    if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
      echo "Adult"
    else
      echo "Minor"
    fi
```
    greet() {
      echo "Hello, $1!"
    }

    greet "Ali"
    # Output: Hello, Ali!

  # Find .log files larger than 10MB
    find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -size +10M > large_logs.txt
